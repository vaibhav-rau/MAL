Mini Aerospace Lab Simulations Hub

Mini Aerospace Lab started as a passion project I built in my spare time. At Georgia Tech, much of our aerospace work is deeply theoretical and often relies on equipment that costs millions of dollars to access. For many people, that can make aerospace feel distant or even unreachable. And when it comes to explaining concepts like vortex lift to a 10-year-old, the challenge becomes even clearer.

That’s why I created Mini Aerospace Lab. It’s completely open source (and contributions are always welcome!) and designed for learners of all ages. Whether you’re a curious kid, a student, or an adult exploring aviation or rocketry for the first time, these interactive simulations are built to make complex aerospace concepts approachable, intuitive, and fun.
